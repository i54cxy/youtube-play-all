## Play All button for YouTube Chrome extension

[Chrome web store link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/Play%20All%20button%20for%20YouTube/lnngonmdpkejhjpobbbonechojbncoll)

I usually find myself in need of this feature however YouTube removed it a while back. There were a few hacks such as a bookmarklets but they either require some manual editing or stopped working. So I finally decided to make this extension.

This extension makes use of [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs).

Let me know if you want localization for a specific language or raise a pull request of your own.
